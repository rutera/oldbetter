Donwgrade instructions

If you have chosen the legacy deb package, follow this instructions to install it:

Requirements: wget

    Uninstall latest 2.x bettercap package
        ~# apt remove bettercap
    Install the ruby dependencies
        ~# apt install ruby-packetfu ruby-colorize ruby-net-dns ruby-em-proxy ruby-network-interface
    Download the legacy deb bettercap package
        ~# wget https://github.com/v1s1t0r1sh3r3/bettercap1.6.2/raw/master/bettercap_1.6.2-0parrot1_all.deb
    Install the downloaded package
        ~# dpkg -i bettercap_1.6.2-0parrot1_all.deb

Additionally, you may want as optional to mark the package as "hold" to avoid its update in order to keep the downgraded compatible version:

~# apt-mark hold bettercap
Important note. This downgrade method was tested only on Kali and Parrot Security Linux.
